                                    <p>The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said
                                        that there was "in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every
                                        forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated
                                        in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and
                                        one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were, last
                                        year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the
                                        city, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to
                                        destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help
                                        save them.'"</p>

                                    <p>But few of the human race die of old age. Besides the thousand and one
                                        diseases flesh is heir to, and the disease which Mrs. O'Flannagan said her
                                        husband died of, viz., "Of a Saturday 'tis that poor Mike died," very many
                                        die of disappointment. More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, "It is the
                                        fretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear."</p>

                                    <p>The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.</p>
    
                                    <p>The Saxons long and long ago got up the delightful occasion. Amongst the
                                        ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and
                                        sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at
                                        weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the
                                        nobility sometimes for a month--"monath." The "hunig monath" was thus
                                        established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the
                                        honeymoon.</p>

                                    <p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly
                                        fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
                                        witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
                                        case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
                                        witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
                                        dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
                                        of the faculty.</p>
